# The Tower of Babel

The biblical story of the Tower of Babel is likely familiar to everyone. In this tale, humanity, which at the time spoke a single language, decided to build a tower reaching to the heavens to "make a name for themselves." However, God opposed this idea and caused people to speak different languages, making them unable to understand one another, which brought the construction to a halt. There are many interpretations of this myth, and the key difference among them lies in what exactly humanity was building. Some believe they were truly constructing a tower to save themselves from the next flood, while others see the tower as a symbol of excessive centralized control that suppresses individuality and freedom. Another version suggests that the ancients were building an observatory.

Let us also try to interpret this metaphor. It is doubtful that building a tower, no matter how high, could anger God. But if we consider the construction as an attempt to invent immortality and thereby become equal to God, the reason for God's anger becomes clear. Based on this interpretation, one possible path to immortality lies in restoring a single language for all of humanity. To avoid wasting time and effort, the chosen language must be the one with the greatest likelihood of succeeding in this role. 

Efforts to create and promote a universal language have been ongoing for more than 200 years, from Solresol and Esperanto to Lingua Franca Nova, but all of them have failed. Understandably, people are reluctant to spend time learning an additional foreign language with questionable prospects and limited practical utility. On the other hand, learning English is an excellent investment, as this language has become the de facto international language due to its widespread use in the scientific community and its dominance in information technology, which has already spread across the globe and shows no signs of disappearing. 

Thus, the candidate for the role of a universal language becomes obviousâ€”it is English. Every effort must be made to ensure that every person on the planet masters it. This section will gather and publish various materials to make learning English easier. We invite all participants in this movement to share their methods and tools that have helped them in this process, as well as to provide any possible assistance to their friends and acquaintances who are in the process of learning it.
