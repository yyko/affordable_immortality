What can be done right now as part of the "Affordable Immortality" movement:

- Share the movement's manifesto with your family, friends, and colleagues.  
- Correct any translation inaccuracies in the manifesto if you are fluent in one of the represented languages.  
- Support a decentralized internet by launching your own node in the IPFS ([Interplanetary File System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InterPlanetary_File_System))
- Decode your own DNA.  
- Write an appeal to the WHO advocating for the recognition of aging as a disease.  
- Learn how to work with GitHub to contribute pull requests to the [project's documentation](https://github.com/yyko/affordable_immortality).  
- Decide to connect your future career with science, medicine, or another field that, in your opinion, could help achieve this goal.  
- Create a tool (video, article, book, course, etc.) to popularize STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics).  
- Learn, improve, and help others master a universal language for humanity (see the "Tower of Babel" section).  
- Learn an unusual language to test the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis and perhaps view the challenges of immortality from a new perspective (see the "Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis" section).  
- Ask yourself the question: "What can I do for immortality right now?"
