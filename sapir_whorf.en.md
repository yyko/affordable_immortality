Many have probably heard of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis. A science fiction film, *Arrival*, was even made based on this hypothesis. The idea behind it is that language influences our perception of the world and our thought processes. In other words, by learning a new language, we gain the ability to think differently and discover unexpected solutions to problems that might be impossible to find within the paradigm of our native language.  

And although it remains just a hypothesis, it’s worth testing in practice. For a greater effect, one should choose a language that is significantly different from natural human languages—just like in *Arrival*. Therefore, it is best to turn to constructed languages, among which the most outstanding in terms of originality is [Ithkuil](https://www.ithkuil.net/) or its dialect, [Ilaksh](https://ithkuil.place/mirror/2004-en/Ilaksh_Intro.html).  

We hope that among the participants of this movement, there will be bold individuals who can master this language to such a degree that it radically transforms their thinking, helping them discover fresh and original solutions to current challenges on the path to immortality.
