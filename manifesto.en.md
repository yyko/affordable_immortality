**Manifesto of the Movement "Accessible Immortality"**

There is no doubt that the powerful of the world are making daily and constant efforts, if not to conquer death, then at least to extend active life as much as possible. However, the deaths of people like David Rockefeller and Jacob Rothschild indicate that the fight against death has seen limited success so far.

It is evident that even if the technology for immortality is discovered, it will likely only be accessible to the ultra-wealthy. What remains for us, the ordinary inhabitants of planet Earth? Will the wealthy share immortality with us? This question is complex and difficult to predict because it is hard, if not impossible, for mortals to understand the psychology of the immortal. Therefore, it is best to accept the worst-case scenario: no, no one will share the technology of immortality with common people. What remains, then, is to pursue this technology on our own. The wealthy may have money and power on their side, but ordinary people have their greatest strength in their numbers. Crowdfunding, a technology that, by the standards of the Scientific and Technological Revolution (STR), is only in its infancy, seems to have emerged specifically to solve the challenge of funding such a project. Recently, technologies like blockchain and IPFS—public distributed databases that cannot be edited or deleted without shutting off power worldwide—have emerged. These technologies will allow the financing, implementation, and public disclosure of research results and developments. Blockchain and smart contract technologies will also enable distributed project management, preventing control of decision-making from being concentrated in a single hand or a small group. All of this has become possible very recently, and it is imperative to start taking advantage of it immediately.

To achieve this goal, the world needs as many scientists and researchers as possible. Ideally, every person on Earth should be a scientist or an engineer. To make this happen, we need to ensure accessible education for all and make every effort to free each person from mechanical, mind-numbing work. Movement participants strive to acquire the knowledge necessary to advance to the cutting edge of science in any field and support the education of others by all available means.

The foundations of the movement at this stage are envisioned as follows:

1. Developing funding and management based on cryptocurrency networks with smart contracts (ICO, DAO);
2. Publishing and preserving research results in distributed, unalterable registries like IPFS;
3. Producing and publishing educational materials for universal higher education.

We invite all who are interested to join in developing the movement’s principles and foundations to ensure the achievement of immortality in any time perspective.

Although immortality may initially be accessible only to the most affluent people on the planet, the "Accessible Immortality" movement aims to hasten this moment as much as possible. Mortals, due to their mortality, often operate under the mindset of "let the future be damned," thereby pushing the responsibility for current problems onto future generations (in essence, onto their children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren). In contrast, an immortal person must resolve these issues now, as they would have to live through the "future" they are shaping. The psychology of the immortal is very different from that of the mortal.

The "Accessible Immortality" movement does not engage in debate with opponents of immortality or skeptics. Believing that a healthy mind should serve life and survival rather than death, we do not wish to join the chorus of "singers of death," who are already numerous enough.

In the movement's view, the main goal of science is to overcome death.
